I wanted to revive an old Futaba FC-16 transmitter, but I did not want to use already obsolete AVR MEGA 2650 so I decided to port OpenTX to ESP32 based boards.

ESP32 is a powerful and cheap processor with a number of analog inputs (max 8 if WiFi radio is used, WROOM based boards have only 6 WiFi compatible ADC pins broken out), but it is a bit short on digital IO pins. Digital ports therefore need to be expanded. A couple MCP23017 I2C 16 IO port ICs was selected. 

The code is heavily based on the SKY9X board code.

The project is still in development. The radio firmware has most of the functionality working. Implemented features are:

- basic functionality (6 analog sticks + Vbatt (when WiFi is off), navigation keys, trims, switches, model storage in SPI flash)
- ST7565P 128x64 SPI display with LED back light
- audio output (needs additional speaker driver)
- 8 channel PPM output
- Frsky RS232 telemetry input. (some others might work but were not tested)
- sdcard support, sound messages work from downloaded Taranis X9 (2.2V0020) SD card
- WiFi ftp server to download/upload files
- OTA firmware update
- integration into Companion through WiFi
- Only English version of translation files (en.h.txt)
- compiles under MinGW 

Compilation

To build radio firmware ESP-IDF environment v4.2 or later is needed (only tested on Windows with ESP-IDF v4.2 snapshot). 

In Windows:
```
cd [build-folder]
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" [OpenTX source folder]/radio/src/targets/common/esp32/esp-idf  -DPCB=ESP_WROOM_32  -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=mingw32-make -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$IDF_PATH/tools/cmake/toolchain-esp32.cmake
mingw32-make flash ESPPORT=[serial-port]  
```
In Linux(not tested):
```
cd [build-folder]
cmake  [OpenTX source folder]/radio/src/targets/common/esp32/esp-idf -DPCB=ESP_WROOM_32 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$IDF_PATH/tools/cmake/toolchain-esp32.cmake
make flash ESPPORT=[serial-port]  
```

OTA firmware upload:
First enable WiFi on the radio. Radio IP will be shown on LCD upon succesfull connection.
```
make ota ESP32_IP=[radio IP]
```

Todo list:

- translation to other languages
- finding if any concurrency issues will arise due to symmetric multiprocessing architecture (task priorities are an initial guess that probably needs more tunning)
- Lua
- additional radio modules support
- remove nonrelevant menu options
